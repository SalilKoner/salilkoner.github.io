                <b>Brief Bio</b> <br>
				Welcome to my webpage!  I am currently a 4th year PhD candidate in statistics in the Department of Statistics and Operations Research at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.  Iâ€™m very fortunate to work under the direction of my adviser Jan Hannig at UNC, and Curt Storlie at the Mayo Clinic.  My research is a combination of statistical theory with Jan, and applied statistics with Curt (applications in medical science).
