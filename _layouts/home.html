                <b>Brief biography</b> 
				<br>
				Welcome to my webpage!  I am currently a 4th year PhD candidate in statistics in the Department of Statistics and Operations Research at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.  Iâ€™m very fortunate to work under the direction of my adviser Jan Hannig at UNC, and Curt Storlie at the Mayo Clinic.  My research is a combination of statistical theory with Jan, and applied statistics with Curt (applications in medical science).  I'm interested in Bayesian and fiducial methods of inference because I believe they faciliate more natural interpetability, but I also think it is wrong to ignore uncertainty with respect to the sampling distribution of the data.  I also believe that even theoretically focused statisticians should spend at least as much time on applications as they do on methods.

				<br>
				Before coming to UNC I studied math and economics at Eastern Michigan University, and completed a master's degree in mathematics from New York University, Courant.  I was very lucky to write a master's thesis under the direction of Ying Lu at NYU.
