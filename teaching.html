<h3><i>Resources</i></h3>
<ul>
  <br>

  <li> <b>Markov chain Monte Carlo simple example</b>.  As part of a short introduction to MCMC during a presentation, I wrote a simple MCMC example.  I now find myself going back to these slides when I help people who are learning about the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm for the first time.  The slides are available <a href="assets/MCMCExamplePres.pdf"><b>HERE</b></a>, and the R source code is avaiable <a href="assets/MCMCExample.r"><b>HERE</b></a>.  A good exercise for those who are new to MCMC is to recreate the example in R (or whatever language), referencing the R source code as needed.
